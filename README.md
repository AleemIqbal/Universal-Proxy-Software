#Universal Proxy Software:
Universal Proxy Software 2.0 is a powerful Windows-based tool that comes equipped with a variety of features related to proxy management. This software is designed to be lightweight and user-friendly, making it easy to use even for those who are new to proxy management. It is built using VB.NET and requires the .NET Framework to be installed on your computer in order to work.

One of the key features of Universal Proxy Software 2.0 is the proxy grabber, which allows you to retrieve a list of proxies from various sources on the internet. The software also supports filtering proxies by type, such as HTTPS, SOCKS4, SOCKS5, or SOCKS5/4, and saving the list of proxies to a plain text file. Additionally, the software features a Mega Proxy Grabber, which retrieves a larger number of proxies and provides log details, including domain addresses.

The software also includes a proxy editor, which enables you to open a file containing multiple proxies, separate the IP addresses from the ports, and save each list to a separate file. The proxy combiner, on the other hand, combines IP addresses and port numbers to create proxies. The proxy checker scans a list of proxies to determine if they are valid or broken, while the proxy leecher finds all leech proxies for a specified URL. The proxy viewer allows you to test a specific proxy when navigating to websites and has a built-in web browser.

Other features of Universal Proxy Software 2.0 include a Mega Proxy Checker, which is fast and supports a large number of proxies, an Auto Proxy Changer that changes your IP automatically, a Mega Proxy Editor for editing a large number of proxies, a Mega Proxy Leecher for leeching proxies from multiple URLs, a Mega Proxy Scrapper for scraping proxies from text using various services, a Mega Proxy Combiner for combining larger amounts of IP addresses and ports, a Mega Proxy Lookup for getting details of multiple IPs, a Mega Proxy Text Leecher for leeching proxies from large text files, a Mor Crawler that can leech up to millions of proxies, a Proxy Viewer, which is a browser based on a proxy, and a Proxy URL Grabber for collecting links using keywords.
