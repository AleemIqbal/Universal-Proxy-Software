This software is designed to be lightweight and user-friendly, making it easy to use even for those who are new to proxy management. It is built using VB.NET and requires the .NET Framework to be installed on your computer in order to work.

One of the key features of Universal Proxy Software 2.0 is the proxy grabber, which allows you to retrieve a list of proxies from various sources on the internet. The software also supports filtering proxies by type, such as HTTPS, SOCKS4, SOCKS5, or SOCKS5/4, and saving the list of proxies to a plain text file. Additionally, the software features a Mega Proxy Grabber, which retrieves a larger number of proxies and provides log details, including domain addresses.
